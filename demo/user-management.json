At Call AI,We realise that consumers want to interact in a number of methods, such as a NodeJS request for an SMS or a desire to get their issue fixed as soon as possible without having to describe their issue to the agent each time they call. All clients want is convenience and reliable customer service.\nOur APIs ensure that consumers have several ways to reach us via incoming and outgoing phone conversations, while also automating workflows and managing growth. Furthermore, the APIs ensure that these calls are handled by agents who manage each call and maintain track of open cases and transactions. Simply put, we strive to create a memorable customer experience.\n
Our APIs enable clients to interact with agents via the channels we employ.

    # Introduction Of API's
    At Call AI,We realise that consumers want to interact in a number of methods, such as a NodeJS request for an SMS or a desire to get their issue fixed as 
    Our APIs ensure that consumers have several ways to reach us via incoming and outgoing phone conversations, while also automating workflows and managing growth. Furthermore, the APIs ensure that these calls are handled by agents who manage each call and maintain track of open cases and transactions. Simply put, we strive to create a memorable customer experience.

    Our APIs enable clients to interact with agents via the channels we employ.
    OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple
    and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.

    # Significance Of Our APIs

    Our APIs allow you to export data from one interface to another, embed data from one interface to another, and enhance functionality. APIs are used to automate the following services:
    
     -1. Improved Customer Service
      If a Patient in Care Treatment calls, they are handled by our DVA (which uses our DVA APIs).

      DVA will obtain all of the details of the calling patient using Data Connection APIs and become fully aware of the patient's health. Also, make it available to customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
      Also, obtain the Reporting APIs in order to run surveys and analyse patient data over the phone in order to verify that the patient's issue is treated.

     -2. Boost Productivity
      Building patients' trust, growing teams, and maintaining consistency in a continuously changing environment and, most crucially, an ever-changing world necessitates the presence of a Care person representative. A representative or a Care Person must not only master the art of communication and listening skills, but also the art of asking quality questions to get to the source of the problem to offer each patient with a speedy, efficient, and enjoyable conversation. So, use our DVA APIs to construct DVA based on use cases in order to give an effective patient service.
      Getting in touch with the DVA! The Patients wishes to communicate with the DVA to become a potential Patient. The two-way call mechanism is used to connect with the DVA, where the inbound or outbound call is connected on any of the DIDs assigned to the DVA or vice versa. Make use of the Number APIs to retrieve the list of DIDs or to update a DID.
      In any of the cases, an outbound call is beneficial. But how can you even begin making outbound calls to different leads when you need to reach hundreds, if not thousands, of people? It's the Click to Call API this time. Also, use the Call Notes APIs to obtain the call's call notes. That is an example of excellent care to patients.

     -3. Scale Elastically
      In many circumstances, Care Persons adhere to a fixed system of prefabricated responses; as a result, the Care Person may become unable to assist valued Patients. To circumvent such challenges, leverage Voice Calls APIs to provide agents some flexibility in how they approach many patients at the same time. If the Care Person is thoroughly aware of the call agenda and the customer's issue, the first step in making a successful call occurs well before anyone rings in.

    # Authentication using Tokens.
    Welcome! Here you will have access to all the resources necessary to build an application successfully.
    At its core, Call AI uses OAUTH 2.0 to provide RESTful access to its resources. Call-ai offers two forms of authentication:
     - Sunbscription Key: Subscriptions are the most common way for API consumers to access APIs.
     - Authorization Token: OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n
